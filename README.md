# Quiz 8.1-8.2 

Below is the coding task for 8.1 - 8.2 Quiz


1. (2 pts) In your ```main``` method, write code that will declare and initialize a 2-D Array called ```seatChart```. The array should model a seating chart for a hypothetical AP CS class ( students' names listed above). JB 32 currently  accommodates 4 students on each side of the room.
2. (3 pts) Write a method called ```getRandomStudent(seatChart)``` that returns the name of a randomly selected student from the seating chart that is passed as a parameter.
3. (3 pts) Write a method called ```printChart(seatChart)``` that prints out the seating chart.
4. (1 pt) Test each of your methods by calling them from the ```main``` method.

- [Extension task - to work on while other students are finishing the Quiz] Overload your ```getRandomStudent()``` method so that you pass in an additional integer parameter for the number of students that you want to randomly select. The method should return an arrayList with the number of students without duplicates. Precondition - number of random students selected will not be larger than class size.
